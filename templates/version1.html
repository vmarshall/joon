            General Quests should always appear in the get_quests response, until it gets completed. On the date that it
            is completed, the completed field should be True. On dates before the completion date, the completed field
            should be False.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">

            Repeating Quests should only appear when the date queried is on a day that it is supposed to repeat (see the
            weekday() function in datetime). If the Quest has been completed that day, completed should be True. If it
            hasnâ€™t been completed on that day, completed should be False.

                                <p class="lead">The following assumptions were made in the design of the v1 API</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>General Quests that are repeatable can't ever be complete</li>
                    <li>Repeatable Quests will return all quests which are not complete and repeatable</li>
                    <li>Repeatable Quests should never have a completed date ( needs error checking )</li>
                    <li>Completed boolean field can only be marked on General Quests ( needs more checks )</li>
                </ul>
